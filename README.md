# fractals
A planned collection of efficient space-filling fractal curve encoders that are of general use for creating spatial data structures.

Currently, the only encoder included is an implementation Butz's algorithm for generating N-dimensional space-filling Hilbert curves.

An encoder for Morton (Z-order) curves is planned for a future release.
